MESH 
====

Mesh is a sleek collaborative online code editor for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

This project is in its early stages and will continue to grow with new features. If something is not working or you would like a new feature, please use the issues page.

## Demo

Click for a demo: <a href="http://farhadg.github.io/mesh-code-editor" target="_blank">Mesh Code Editor</a>.

## Languages

<table>

<td>HTML</td>
<td>CSS</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JavaScript</td>
<td>jQuery</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Installation

You can simply fork and clone (or download) Mesh into your local directory:

```
  $ git clone https://www.github.com/farhadg/mesh-code-editor
```

## Usage

Fire up `index.html` for the online code editor. You will be presented with some default text that'll provide you an idea of the layout.

The preview box can be adjusted and dragged around. Be sure to select and drag around the edges (handlers), since the contents within the frame are exempt of this behaviour.

You can also switch between a dark or light theme.

For basic editor modifications, checkout `js/app.js` and `css/style.css`.

## Options

I'll be adding more meshing features; that said, if you'd like a feature, let me know so that I'll try and implement it into future updates.
