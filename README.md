MESH 
====

Mesh is a sleek online code editor  

This project is in its early stages and will continue to grow with new features. If something is not working or you would like a new feature, please use the issues page.

```

## Usage

Fire up `index.html` for the online code editor. You will be presented with some default text that'll provide you an idea of the layout.

The preview box can be adjusted and dragged around for your meshing convenience. Be sure to select and drag around the edges (handlers), since the content within the box are independent of this behaviour.

For basic modifications to the editor, checkout `js/app.js` and `css/style.css`.

## Options

More meshing features will be added; if you'd like a feature, let me know so that I'll try and implement it into future updates.
